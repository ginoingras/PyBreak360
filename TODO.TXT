I have not found anything playing with more than 2 childrens with serverals computers.
An addictive game, easy, and not too long playing time.
So, i made it: an arkanoid / breakout clone which have the particularity to play at 360Â°.

see pybreak360.cfg to fine configure outside game.

game use mouse or LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN.
on game, press SPACE or ENTER for menu.
select level pack using menu/F9.
see in levels/*.level to edit/create your own level.
each level can be fine configured as speed ball, bricks quantity, width spaced, shifted, ...
press PAGE_UP, PAGE_DOWN to change level in actual level pack.

you can play alone, with ComputerBootPlayer, or humans muliplayers.
connect up to 4 players via TCP network.
press B to start/stop ComputerBootPlayer.
press H to see HiScores.
press D for level designer.
select Server using menu/F1, connect/disconnect using menu/F10.

you can't play (yet) several players on the same computer.
it was not the 1st objective.

A good gameplay experience, 10 bricks bonus, more then 90 levels, ...
I hope you'll have as much fun playing it that i got programing (and playing it) also.

i apologize that code certainly doesn't Pythonic (1st release only in 4 weeks).
some comments are already fixed or outdated/incoherente...
i have to clean it (a lot).

TODO / know issues:
Game:
allow all 4 players on same (maybe screen?) server, use keys in pybreak360.cfg: AZES, IOPL, 4562.

More:
modify/enhance menu (needed add for android: B,H,D,PGUP-PGDWN)
modify levelEditor to change BricksArray size.
add autocheck updates function at launch.
add brick bonus invisible ball, timed 3 sec (sprite already exist).
add ball lazer trajectory help BrickBonus (may or not shown only on ballowner screen display?).
add 2nd (and more) ball brick bonus.
add invisible brick (No8? status? as bonus?).
allows bonus bricks to be hiden by normal bricks.
send text messages in menu mode between clients (chat).
adapt locking mouse radius-perimeter when changing screen size.almost correct.
show players connected in real time in menu mode (actually only entering mode).
enhance bats (and bricks?) design.
enhance AI ComputerBoot.

Code:
rename sounds explicitly.
translate comments in code to be completly english.
clean terminal debug, use logfile, use verbose level 1,2,3...
change players bats in objects class elements.
extract network class in file to import.
compatibility with Python3
support for android
create an .deb or setup.py, pip for linux (DONE: and exe file for windows.)


WARNING:
BigBall 32pix isn't Rect centered (and certainly normal ball 17pix too)
change local server ip F11 may have no th_E/R/SerCli issues when reconnect
multiplayers not playing all sounds (start/lose ball event is on server only) in clients network.
too much multiplayers sounds?
menu mode have to pause others players in network game.
start and end game, display final score, (may enhance, not satisfy) check synchonus with multiplayers clients.

communication network work well but is not optimized (specially for windows clients).
some traffic only need to tarjet one client (penality time, ...)
add "continue" when possible on th_recive and th_ServerClient
somes differences between Linux and MsWindows (as Win need to send \n when something recived to be responsive).
check if better that ball/bullet client which impact have to wait his status from server?
REFLEXION:
?

FIXME:
Nothing emergency else?
